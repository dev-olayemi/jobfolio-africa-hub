# Cloudinary (client-side unsigned preset) - used by the frontend when VITE_ vars are present
# Create an unsigned upload preset in the Cloudinary dashboard and set the preset name below.
# For development you can use an unsigned preset, but for production or sensitive files (passports, IDs,
# CVs with PII) prefer a server-side signed upload flow and keep API_SECRET off the client.

VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=dnhjyviwe
VITE_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=your_unsigned_preset_name

# Optional (server-side only) - DO NOT commit these to git. Use them only in your backend environment.
# If you implement a server upload endpoint, set these on the server (not the client).
# CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=528857853362557
# CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret_here

# Example Firebase (already configured elsewhere in this project) - add if you need to override
# VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
# VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
# VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
# VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_bucket_name

# Instructions:
# 1. Copy this file to .env (or .env.local) in the project root.
# 2. Replace the placeholder values with your actual settings (do NOT add API secret to client env).
# 3. Restart the Vite dev server so the new env vars are loaded.
